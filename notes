when trying to compile on my machine i got some errors to do with the order in the command
gcc -g -o remux remux.c -L/usr/local/lib/ -I/usr/local/include -lavformat -lavcodec -lavdevice -lavutil -lswresample -lz -lm -lpthread
but i think in the end the above worked.
in general maybe below can be useful

also in FFMPEG github repo, the code builds ok
can play with examples, to build them i think 'make examples'


TODO
in FFMPEG github repo to analyse - ffplay, ffprobe
